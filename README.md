## Data Flow and Architecture

The homepage is a simple, modular, client-side app built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. It uses Local Storage for persistence.

### High-Level Flow
1. **Boot**
   - Read persisted settings and data from `localStorage` (theme, favorites, notes, todos, bookmarks).
   - Render initial page and attach event listeners.
2. **User Interaction**
   - UI events (click, submit, drag/drop, toggle) call handlers.
   - Handlers update in-memory state and write changes to `localStorage`.
3. **Render**
   - After each change, the relevant section re-renders from state.
4. **Persist**
   - Data is saved under defined keys; on reload, the UI restores from saved state.

### Module Responsibilities
- **Favorites**: Manage an array of link objects; render grid; delete via inline button; persist to `favorites` key.
- **Notes**: Manage note objects with `title` and `content`; render cards; persist to `notes` key.
- **Todos**: Manage task objects with `dueDate` and `completed`; compute overdue; persist to `todos` key.
- **Bookmarks**: Parse imported HTML, normalize items, group by folders, render list/grid; persist to `bookmarks` key.
- **Feeds**: Provide mock articles for each source to demonstrate layout; lazy-load on scroll; no persistence required.
- **Theme**: Toggle attribute on `<body>` (e.g., `data-theme="dark"`); persist to `theme` key.

### Event ‚Üí State ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí UI
- Example (Add Favorite):
  1) User submits form ‚Üí 2) Create favorite object ‚Üí 3) Push to favorites array ‚Üí 4) `localStorage.setItem('favorites', JSON)` ‚Üí 5) Re-render favorites grid.
- Example (Toggle Theme):
  1) Click theme button ‚Üí 2) Flip `data-theme` ‚Üí 3) `localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark'|'light')` ‚Üí 4) CSS variables update theme instantly.
- Example (Import Bookmarks):
  1) Drop file ‚Üí 2) Read/parse bookmark HTML ‚Üí 3) Map to normalized entries ‚Üí 4) Save to `bookmarks` ‚Üí 5) Render grouped view with favicons.

Keys and example structures used by the app:

```json
// favorites
[
  {
    "id": 1694000000,
    "label": "GitHub",
    "url": "https://github.com",
    "icon": "fab fa-github"

## Setup

### Quick Start
1. Download and extract: https://github.com/awes0m/awesom_browser_tools/raw/refs/heads/main/awesom_cybersec_home.zip
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or host via a simple local server.

### Set as Browser Homepage (Local File)
Set your homepage to the local file path, for example:

```text
file:///C:/Users/You/Downloads/awesom_browser_tools/index.html
```

Step-by-step guides are provided for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera, and Brave in this README (search for your browser).

### Run a Local Server (Recommended)
To avoid any file URL restrictions and for best performance:

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000
# Node.js
npx http-server
# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000

## Usage

2. Provide Label, URL, and Font Awesome icon class.
3. Submit to save; tile appears in the grid. Hover to reveal quick delete.

### Notes

2. Enter title and content. Notes are listed with latest first.

### Tasks
1. Click "Add Task".
2. Enter description and optional due date.
3. Overdue tasks are styled distinctly; mark complete when done.

### Bookmark Import
1. Export from your browser as HTML.
2. Drag-and-drop the file onto the import area, or click to select.
3. Bookmarks are parsed and grouped by folder with favicons.

### Theme
- Use the theme toggle in the header. The choice is saved and restored on next visit.

## Browser Support
- Modern Browsers: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- Mobile: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- Uses CSS Grid/Flexbox, Local Storage API, File API, and CSS custom properties

---

## Development Notes
- Single-file architecture with embedded CSS/JS for easy distribution
- Structure emphasizes clear sections, modular functions, and minimal dependencies
- Feeds use mock data client-side to bypass CORS; real feeds require a backend proxy or server-side worker

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bookmarks Not Importing
- Ensure the file is a valid HTML bookmark export
- Check browser console for parsing errors
- Try the provided sample `sample-bookmarks.html`

### Favicons Not Loading
- Some sites block favicon requests; a default icon is used when unavailable

### Feeds Not Loading
- The demo uses mock data; real-time fetching requires a backend due to CORS

### Data Not Persisting
- Confirm Local Storage is enabled and not cleared on exit
- Avoid private/incognito mode if you want persistence
